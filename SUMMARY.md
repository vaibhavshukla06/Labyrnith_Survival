# Labyrinth Survival - Project Summary

## Overview

Labyrinth Survival is a multiplayer survival escape game with a Minecraft-style aesthetic. Players must explore a procedurally generated, shifting voxel-based maze, find clues, craft tools, and survive against AI-controlled monsters while working together or potentially betraying each other.

## Implemented Features

We've implemented the core structure and essential scripts for the game:

1. **Procedural Maze Generation**
   - Hybrid approach using Prim's Algorithm and Wave Function Collapse
   - Dynamic maze shifting over time
   - Guaranteed solvable mazes with path validation

2. **Multiplayer Networking**
   - Photon Fusion integration for reliable networking
   - Host mode with relay servers
   - Player synchronization and input handling

3. **Player Systems**
   - Character movement and interaction
   - Health and damage system
   - Inventory management
   - Escape mechanics

4. **AI Enemies**
   - State machine-based AI behavior (Idle, Patrol, Chase, Attack)
   - NavMesh pathfinding for intelligent navigation
   - Line of sight detection

5. **Game Modes**
   - Co-op Mode: Work together to escape
   - Betrayal Mode: Only one player can escape
   - PvP Mode: Players can sabotage each other

6. **UI System**
   - Main menu and lobby
   - In-game HUD
   - Inventory interface
   - Game over screen

7. **Core Game Flow**
   - Game initialization and setup
   - Win/loss conditions
   - Player escape mechanics

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure with clear separation of concerns:

- **Core**: Game manager, scene setup, exit trigger, and other core systems
- **Networking**: Network manager and multiplayer functionality
- **Procedural**: Maze generation algorithms
- **Player**: Player controller and interaction systems
- **AI**: Enemy AI and behavior
- **UI**: User interface elements and management

## Next Steps

To complete the game, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Asset Creation**
   - Create voxel-style models for players, monsters, walls, and items
   - Design textures with a Minecraft-inspired aesthetic
   - Create sound effects and background music

2. **Feature Expansion**
   - Implement a crafting system for tools and weapons
   - Add more item types and interactions
   - Create traps and obstacles in the maze
   - Implement player abilities and skills

3. **Polish and Optimization**
   - Optimize network performance for larger player counts
   - Add visual effects for actions and events
   - Implement a tutorial system
   - Add difficulty settings

4. **Testing and Balancing**
   - Test multiplayer functionality with multiple clients
   - Balance monster difficulty and spawn rates
   - Adjust maze complexity and shifting frequency
   - Fine-tune player movement and combat

## Technical Considerations

- **Performance**: The dynamic maze shifting and AI pathfinding can be resource-intensive. Consider optimizing these systems for larger mazes and player counts.
- **Network Synchronization**: Ensure all important game state is properly synchronized across clients.
- **Scalability**: Design systems to be easily expandable for adding new features and content.

## Conclusion

The Labyrinth Survival project provides a solid foundation for a multiplayer survival game with procedural content. The modular design allows for easy expansion and customization, while the use of Photon Fusion ensures reliable networking for a smooth multiplayer experience.

By following the setup guide in ProjectSettings.md and building upon the existing codebase, you can create a fully featured game with engaging gameplay mechanics and a unique aesthetic.
